# FastAPI Advanced Logging & Analytics System

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, enterprise-grade logging and analytics system for your FastAPI application. This system provides real-time monitoring, structured logging, and powerful analytics capabilities using industry best practices.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Backend Logging Architecture** (`app/core/advanced_logging.py`)
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: For powerful search and analytics capabilities
- **Database Logging**: Critical logs stored in SQLite/PostgreSQL for persistence
- **File Rotation**: Automatic log rotation with size limits and retention
- **Console Logging**: Structured JSON output for development
- **Sentry Integration**: Real-time error tracking and alerting

### 2. **Automated Request/Response Monitoring** (`app/middleware/logging_middleware.py`)
- **Request Tracking**: Every API call tracked with unique request IDs
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, status codes, and throughput
- **Security Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious patterns and unauthorized access
- **Client Analytics**: User agent, IP address, and geographic data tracking
- **Error Correlation**: Automatic linking of errors to specific requests

### 3. **Real-Time Log Analysis** (`app/utils/log_analyzer_simple.py`)
- **Error Analysis**: Pattern detection, frequency analysis, and root cause identification
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time analysis, bottleneck detection
- **Security Alerts**: Real-time detection of security events and anomalies
- **User Activity**: User behavior tracking and activity summaries
- **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for critical events

### 4. **Comprehensive REST API** (`app/api/v1/endpoints/logs.py`)
Available at `/api/v1/logs/` (requires superuser authentication):

- `GET /logs/health` - System health status and alerts
- `GET /logs/errors` - Error analysis and patterns
- `GET /logs/performance` - API performance metrics  
- `GET /logs/security` - Security event analysis
- `GET /logs/users/activity` - User activity summaries
- `GET /logs/report/daily` - Comprehensive daily reports
- `GET /logs/alerts/active` - Current active alerts
- `GET /logs/search` - Advanced log search with filters

## 📊 Logging Capabilities

### **Structured JSON Logging**
Every log entry includes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-14T11:01:46.503939+00:00",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "Fast Users API",
  "message": "API call: GET /docs",
  "module": "logging_middleware",
  "function": "dispatch",
  "line": 41,
  "request_id": "d29c0fa5-cfa3-467d-8a8a-81bac38a1ac0",
  "duration_ms": 9.17,
  "status_code": 200,
  "client_ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "event_type": "api_performance"
}
```

### **Performance Tracking**
- Request/response timing
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU usage patterns
- API endpoint performance rankings

### **Security Monitoring**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious IP addresses
- Rate limiting violations
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting detection

## 🎮 How to Use

### **1. Access Monitoring Dashboard**
Visit the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs and navigate to the "logging & monitoring" section.

### **2. Authentication Required**
All logging endpoints require superuser authentication:
```bash
# Login as admin
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -d "username=admin&password=secret123"

# Use the returned token for logging endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/logs/health" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### **3. Monitor Real-Time Logs**
Watch the console output to see structured JSON logs for every request with detailed metrics.

### **4. Set Up External Services (Optional)**
- **Elasticsearch**: Set `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environment variable
- **Sentry**: Configure `SENTRY_DSN` for error tracking
- **Prometheus**: Metrics available for collection

## 📈 Analytics Features

### **Error Analysis**
- Most common error types and frequencies
- Affected modules and functions
- Error rate trends and spikes
- Root cause correlation

### **Performance Metrics**
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Slowest endpoints identification
- Request volume analysis
- Database query optimization insights

### **Security Intelligence**
- Failed authentication patterns
