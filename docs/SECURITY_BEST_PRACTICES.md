# ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices for FastAPI Projects

## 1. Change Default Credentials
- Update superuser username, password, and email in `.env` before production.

## 2. Use Strong SECRET_KEY
- Generate a secure, random key for JWT and session management.

## 3. Configure CORS Properly
- Restrict `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` to trusted domains in production.

## 4. Use HTTPS
- Always use SSL/TLS in production deployments.

## 5. Set Up Logging
- Use structured logging for all requests and errors.
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Elasticsearch, Sentry).

## 6. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (middleware or external tools).

## 7. Keep Dependencies Updated
- Regularly run `safety check` and `bandit` for vulnerabilities.

## 8. Database Security
- Use strong passwords for database users.
- Restrict database access to trusted hosts/networks.

## 9. API Security
- Validate all incoming data with Pydantic schemas.
- Use role-based access control for sensitive endpoints.
- Avoid exposing internal errors to clients.

## 10. Regular Audits
- Review code and dependencies for security issues.
- Run automated tests and security scans before deployment.
